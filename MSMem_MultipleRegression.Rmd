## Some statistical choices
# VIF
vif explanation: https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/car/versions/3.0-10/topics/vif

should be less than 10 to assess for colinearity in models

if there is colinearity, like between IQ aned edu, can include 1 in model. check with VIF. variance inflation factor. if more than X its bad


# Checking model assumptions
 For linear regression:
 - residuals are normally distributed: QQ plot for normality, points should follow the line, and shapiro.test() if not sig means there's no danger here 
 - relationship between x and y are linear: residuals vs fitted plot should be straight horizontal line 
 - homogeneity of variance of residuals: ncvTest(model) from car package formally tests this 
 - predictors are uncorrelated: VIF calculation 
 - residuals are independent of each other 
 - no bad outliers: residuals vs leverage plot to check for outliers, any points outside the dotted red line which indicates cooks distance should be investigated

# Prepare the data 

To statistically test, we will z-score across groups at each threshold, average the z-scored degree across thresholds, and then correlate once

```{r}

# z score across thresholds, for each hemisphere 
for (cost in c("05","10","15","20","25","30","35","40","45")){
  for (hem in c("L","R")){
    eval(parse(text = paste0("po_data$",hem,"_cost",cost,"_z<-scale(po_data$",hem,"_cost",cost,")")))
  }
}

# average across thresholds 
po_data$mean_L_degree<-rowMeans(po_data[ , c("L_cost05_z","L_cost10_z","L_cost15_z","L_cost20_z","L_cost25_z","L_cost30_z","L_cost35_z","L_cost40_z","L_cost45_z")])

po_data$mean_R_degree<-rowMeans(po_data[ , c("R_cost05_z","R_cost10_z","R_cost15_z","R_cost20_z","R_cost25_z","R_cost30_z","R_cost35_z","R_cost40_z","R_cost45_z")])

# LTLE

## Models

### Verbal memory change predicted by matrix similarity + degree
```{r}

# model 
model<-lm(VerbalFactor ~ MatrixSim_64_scaled + mean_L_degree, data=po_data, na.action=na.omit, subset=Group=="LTLE")

# check model assumptions 
plot(model) # residuals vs fitted should be straight, no bad outliers
hist(residuals(model)) # residuals should be normal
shapiro.test(residuals(model)) # residuals should be normal
ncvTest(model) # test for heterogeneity of variance
vif(model) ## variance inflation should be less than 10 

# stats 
summary(model) ##when using just full ATL cases, both degree and MS predicts outcome 

# variance explained 
summ(model, part.corr=TRUE) ### part.r is semipartial corr, partial.r is partial corr. 
#semi-partial correlation = does A influence B above and beyond C influence on B? 
#partial correlation = what is the correlation between A and B after accounting for fact that C influences both? 
## to get unique variance, we want semi-partial corrs. to get shared variance, subtract sub of semi-partial from total model r2 
# remember these are rs, need to square to get % variance explained 
```

### Verbal memory change predicted by matrix similarity + degree + clinical and demographic variables 
```{r}
## model 
model2<-lm(VerbalFactor ~ MatrixSim_64_scaled + mean_L_degree + Pre_Verb + MTS_status +age1 +sex +edu +AOO, data=po_data, na.action=na.omit, subset=Group=="LTLE")

# check model assumptions 
plot(model2) # residuals vs fitted should be straight, no bad outliers
hist(residuals(model2)) # residuals should be normal
shapiro.test(residuals(model2)) # residuals should be normal
ncvTest(model2) # test for heterogeneity of variance
vif(model2) ## variance inflation should be less than 10 

# stats 
summary(model2) ##when using just full ATL cases, both degree and MS predicts outcome 

# variance explained 
summ(model2, part.corr=TRUE) ### part.r is semipartial corr, partial.r is partial corr. 
#semi-partial correlation = does A influence B above and beyond C influence on B? 
#partial correlation = what is the correlation between A and B after accounting for fact that C influences both? 
## to get unique variance, we want semi-partial corrs. to get shared variance, subtract sub of semi-partial from total model r2 
# remember these are rs, need to square to get % variance explained 
```

# Compare models with and without clinical and demographic variables 
```{r}

anova(model,model2)

```

# RTLE

## Models

### Visual memory change predicted by clinical and demographic variables

We already know matrix similarity and degree are not associated with visual memory change, so we don't include them here. 

```{r}
# model 
model<-lm(VisualFactor ~ Pre_Vis +MTS_status +age1 +sex +edu +AOO, data=po_data, na.action=na.omit, subset=Group=="RTLE") 

# check model assumptions 
plot(model2) # residuals vs fitted should be straight, no bad outliers
hist(residuals(model2)) # residuals should be normal
shapiro.test(residuals(model2)) # residuals should be normal
ncvTest(model2) # test for heterogeneity of variance
vif(model2) ## variance inflation should be less than 10 

# stats 
summary(model)

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
